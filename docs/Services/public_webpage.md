# Public Webpage

## Purpose
The `public-webpage` provides a centralized, EDHREC-style dashboard for users to explore simulation results, deck rankings, meta insights, and contributed games. It serves as the primary user-facing view into the platformâ€™s data and AI output, enabling transparency and community interaction.

## Responsibilities
- Display searchable deck statistics, win rates, and archetype analysis.
- Serve replays, annotations, and value indexes.
- Highlight community contributors and simulation leaderboards.
- Provide educational overlays and model insights from AI training.
- Link to tools for prediction, submission, and feedback.

## Key Features
- Commander and decklist browser with filters.
- Deck vs. meta matchup explorer.
- Replay gallery with tagging and explanation overlays.
- Value tracker (price vs. performance).
- Public leaderboard of volunteer simulators.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for missing data or simulation failures.

## Inputs
- Aggregated game outcomes from `result-aggregator`
- Deck metadata from `deck-service`
- Replay metadata and logs from `replay-indexer`
- Card IRs and prices from `card-ir-registry` and `value-index-service`
- User feedback, annotations, and predictions

## Outputs
- HTML/JS-based interactive dashboard
- API data queries to `api-gateway`
- Optional CSV/JSON export for advanced users

## Execution Flow

    participant PW as Public Webpage
    participant RA as Result Aggregator
    participant DS as Deck Service
    participant RI as Replay Indexer
    participant VIS as Value Index Service
    participant API as API Gateway

    PW->>RA: Fetch aggregated game outcomes
    PW->>DS: Fetch deck metadata
    PW->>RI: Fetch replay metadata
    PW->>VIS: Fetch value indexes
    PW->>API: Query external tools (e.g., predictions)
    API->>PW: Return external tool data
    PW->>PW: Render interactive dashboard
```

## Integration Points
- Queries:
   - `api-gateway`
   - `replay-indexer`
   - `value-index-service`
   - `deck-service`
   - `auth-service` (if login features enabled)

## Deployment
- Static frontend app (React/Vue/Svelte) served via CDN or backend
- Connects to backend through REST APIs or GraphQL
- Scalable caching and optional SSR for SEO and performance
