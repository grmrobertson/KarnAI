Observability Strategy
======================

Overview:
---------
The observability strategy ensures comprehensive monitoring, logging, and analysis of all system components, microservices, and simulations. Its purpose is to maintain performance, reliability, and transparency throughout the entire MTG AI simulation pipeline.

Components:
-----------
1. Logging:
   - Structured logs captured for each microservice.
   - Includes detailed metadata (action tags, decisions, convergence metrics).
   - Centralized logging repository (e.g., ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

2. Metrics and Monitoring:
   - Prometheus for real-time metrics collection (CPU, memory, latency, throughput).
   - Grafana dashboards to visualize system health, performance trends, and convergence metrics.
   - Custom metrics include agent decision confidence, strategic tag effectiveness, and Bayesian convergence rates.

3. Tracing and Correlation:
   - Distributed tracing using OpenTelemetry or Jaeger.
   - End-to-end traceability of simulation workflows, agent decisions, and inter-service communication.
   - Trace correlation IDs for pinpointing performance bottlenecks and anomalies.

4. Alerting:
   - Real-time alerting via Prometheus Alertmanager.
   - Configurable alerts for critical issues (e.g., service downtime, pod failures, convergence anomalies).
   - Integration with incident response tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Slack).

5. Auditability and Explainability:
   - Structured decision logs and explanation metadata from `explanation-service`.
   - Replay logs and annotations for strategic validation.
   - Auditable trails of convergence decisions, reward shaping adjustments, and shadow policy comparisons.

Integration Points:
-------------------
- Logs and metrics emitted from all services (simulation, agent, reward shaping, etc.).
- Centralized logging and metrics storage.
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for immediate feedback and continuous improvement.
- Dashboards for stakeholders and technical teams to quickly assess system health.

Deployment and Scalability:
---------------------------
- Observability components containerized and orchestrated with Kubernetes.
- Scalable horizontally to handle large volumes of logs and metrics data.
- Optimized for minimal overhead during high-throughput simulations.

Conclusion:
-----------
Comprehensive observability enables proactive identification of issues, deep transparency into system behavior, and ongoing performance optimization. It provides the foundation for reliable, maintainable, and continuously improving system operations.
