Convergence Strategy
====================

Overview:
---------
The convergence strategy defines the methods and criteria used to determine when simulation runs have provided sufficient statistical evidence to confidently rank decks and strategic choices. This strategy leverages Bayesian statistical modeling, confidence intervals, adaptive epoch-sizing, and continuous feedback loops with reward shaping and agent exploration tuning.

Bayesian Statistical Modeling:
------------------------------
- Employs Bayesian methods to model deck performance, pod matchups, and action effectiveness.
- Calculates posterior probability distributions to estimate true win rates and placement likelihoods.

Confidence Interval Thresholds:
-------------------------------
- Sets configurable convergence thresholds (e.g., 99%, 99.9%, 99.999%) for different use cases:
  - 99% confidence for quick prototyping or validation runs.
  - 99.999% confidence for full-scale, rigorous deck-ranking simulations.
- Continuously monitors confidence intervals to determine when decks or pods have reached statistical stability.

Adaptive Epoch Sizing:
----------------------
- Adjusts the number of simulated games per epoch dynamically based on current convergence progress.
- Smaller epochs are used early or when rapid exploration is beneficial.
- Larger epochs are triggered when approaching convergence thresholds for increased precision.

Exploration Tuning:
-------------------
- Uses Bayesian convergence feedback to dynamically adjust agent exploration rates.
- High uncertainty (low convergence) triggers increased exploration.
- High convergence scores decrease exploration, optimizing simulation efficiency.

Reward Shaping Feedback:
------------------------
- Bayesian convergence scores are directly integrated into the reward shaping strategy.
- Confidence and convergence data inform reward decay processes, ensuring stale or ineffective actions are phased out.

Convergence Workflow:
---------------------
1. Simulations run and produce initial placement and outcome data.
2. `bayesian-evaluator` ingests data to calculate Bayesian posterior distributions.
3. Evaluator continuously checks if confidence intervals meet defined convergence thresholds.
4. When convergence is achieved:
   - Pod simulation stops, and results are archived.
   - Reward shaping strategies are updated to reflect stable outcomes.
   - Agent exploration rates are adjusted to prioritize stable performance over unnecessary variability.
5. If convergence is not met:
   - Additional simulations are dispatched automatically.
   - Exploration may increase, and reward shaping remains adaptive.

Integration Points:
-------------------
- Receives simulation results from `result-aggregator`.
- Outputs convergence signals to `matchmaker`, `pod-meta-controller`, and `agent-service`.
- Provides direct feedback to `reward-shaping-agent` for dynamic reward adjustments.
- Integrates with visualization and analytics through dashboard services.

Deployment and Scalability:
---------------------------
- Lightweight and containerized for easy horizontal scaling.
- Deployed via Kubernetes, with real-time or batch execution modes.
- Kafka-based integration ensures rapid, reliable data communication.

Conclusion:
-----------
This convergence strategy ensures simulation efficiency, computational resource optimization, and statistically robust deck rankings. By incorporating Bayesian modeling, adaptive epochs, and integrated reward shaping feedback, it delivers reliable, actionable insights for agent training and strategic development.
