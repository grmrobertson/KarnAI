# KarnAI

## Overview

**Karn.ai** is a modular, microservice-based AI simulation system designed for _Magic: The Gathering's_ Commander (EDH) format. It simulates 4-player pods, trains reinforcement learning agents, and evaluates decks based on strategic tag impact and win condition alignment.

The platform supports:
- Distributed simulation across internal and community-hosted clients
- Advanced AI training using RLlib (PPO, A2C) with reward shaping and Bayesian convergence
- Archetype-aware decision making and deck performance ranking
- Fully indexed, replayable game logs for education and transparency

> _Train Commander agents. Rank decks. Understand strategy._

## Current stage: Initial dev

## Current Goals
### 1. Proof of concept
 [] Fully compliant CR rules engine
 [] Card pool of Commander pre-cons implimented
 [] AI training runs for simulating gameplay with Commander pre-cons completed.
